# RunLab Calculator

Modern running calculator with four features:

1. Speed converter: `km/h` -> `min/km`.
2. Distance time estimator: `distance (0-1000m)` + `pace (min/km)` -> expected time.
3. Race planner: race distance + goal time or target pace -> required pace or predicted finish time.
4. 400m track simulator: split times at 100m/200m/300m/400m + animated runner.

## Local run

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Example

- `10 km/h` => `6:00 min/km`
- `330m` at `4:00 min/km` => `1:19`
